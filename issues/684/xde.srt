1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,790
- [Narrator] The world is unpredictable,

2
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:04,759
and you never know when your<br>life might come under threat.

3
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:06,389
It pays to be prepared.

4
00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:09,570
But not everyone possesses<br>inbuilt survival instincts.

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,259
Can you defeat these 10 riddles

6
00:00:11,259 --> 00:00:13,310
that you must solve to stay alive?

7
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:14,691
Let's find out.

8
00:00:14,691 --> 00:00:17,274
(gentle music)

9
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,809
Number 10.

10
00:00:19,809 --> 00:00:21,109
Head Above Water.

11
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:22,719
Imagine you're trapped in a room

12
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:24,589
and it's slowly filling with water.

13
00:00:24,589 --> 00:00:26,410
You've checked everywhere<br>and there's no way

14
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,679
to turn off the water,<br>or to make an escape.

15
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:30,170
And you can feel the water level

16
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:32,310
rising with every passing second.

17
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:35,200
It's not only the coldness of<br>the water making you squeal,

18
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,829
but the knowledge that<br>help is five minutes away,

19
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:39,570
and you only have two minutes or so

20
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,740
until the entire room is flooded.

21
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:42,850
There's no way you can hold

22
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,409
your breath for three minutes.

23
00:00:44,409 --> 00:00:47,850
You do, however, have a<br>straw, a rope, and a bucket.

24
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,280
And one of them has the power to

25
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,299
buy you time and save your life.

26
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:52,289
Which item is it?

27
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:53,122
Be quick.

28
00:00:53,122 --> 00:00:55,662
You only have 10 seconds<br>to come up with a plan.

29
00:00:56,899 --> 00:00:59,316
(drum beats)

30
00:01:06,219 --> 00:01:08,769
Now, maybe you could use<br>the straw like a snorkel,

31
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:10,159
but that won't be helpful once

32
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,670
the water reaches the ceiling.

33
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,540
The rope would be useful in so many

34
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,040
other life-or-death situations, but sorry,

35
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,760
it's no good to you right now.

36
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,760
It's actually the bucket that will buy you

37
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,959
a little extra time until help arrives.

38
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:24,310
Turn it upside-down,<br>put it over your head,

39
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:26,120
and you'll have an air<br>bubble that will give you

40
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,900
the extra minutes you<br>need until help arrives.

41
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:29,930
Number nine.

42
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,629
A Faulty Parachute.

43
00:01:31,629 --> 00:01:33,939
Now, you decide to do a group skydive to

44
00:01:33,939 --> 00:01:36,319
celebrate not drowning, because why not?

45
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:37,609
As you leap from the plane,

46
00:01:37,609 --> 00:01:39,230
you feel like you're truly flying

47
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:40,739
and you're more alive than ever.

48
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:42,060
Not for long, though.

49
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,030
Your bad luck continues and<br>your parachute doesn't open.

50
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,750
You're plummeting from the<br>sky at an alarming rate.

51
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,180
And as you spin out of control,

52
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,950
you see the hard ground<br>below rushing up at you.

53
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,049
How are you going to get<br>out of this predicament?

54
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:56,159
Are you going to curl into<br>a ball to protect your

55
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,280
head and your internal<br>organs from the impact?

56
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,569
Will you put your faith<br>in the reserve parachute?

57
00:02:00,569 --> 00:02:01,939
Or will you try and maneuver to

58
00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:04,250
another skydiver and cling onto them?

59
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,082
Be quick.

60
00:02:05,082 --> 00:02:06,599
You only have 10 seconds until

61
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:09,031
it's too late to save yourself.

62
00:02:09,031 --> 00:02:11,448
(drum beats)

63
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,960
The answer to your problem is clear.

64
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,599
The reserve parachute is the only

65
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:24,469
thing guaranteed to save your life.

66
00:02:24,469 --> 00:02:27,020
Curling up into a ball<br>might minimize damage,

67
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,539
but it also might not.

68
00:02:28,539 --> 00:02:30,849
And as for clinging to another skydiver,

69
00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:32,430
you'll get them killed too.

70
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,280
Number eight.

71
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,430
Paws of Death.

72
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:37,539
Back on land, you're out for a<br>stroll in the great outdoors.

73
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:38,879
It's a beautiful, sunny day

74
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,509
and you're whistling as you walk.

75
00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:42,210
You're daydreaming about<br>what you'll have for

76
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,250
lunch once you get back to your campsite.

77
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,520
So much, though, that you<br>don't notice the huge,

78
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,099
brown bear standing a few<br>meters in front of you.

79
00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:51,259
A wave of panic washes over you as the

80
00:02:51,259 --> 00:02:53,479
bear looks into your eyes and growls.

81
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:56,080
What will you do to<br>escape the paws of death?

82
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,460
Should you stand your ground<br>and try to scare it off?

83
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:01,560
Maybe you can go the Doctor<br>Dolittle route and befriend it.

84
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,750
Should you run away as fast as you can?

85
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,050
Or should you drop to<br>the ground and play dead?

86
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,229
The bear's approaching.

87
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:09,221
Make your decision.

88
00:03:09,221 --> 00:03:11,638
(drum beats)

89
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,300
Standing your ground might<br>work with a black bear,

90
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,860
as they're much less<br>territorial or aggressive.

91
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:27,319
But a brown bear won't back<br>down to a tiny human like you.

92
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:29,120
Running away or befriending a bear

93
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,629
isn't a wise move, no matter the type.

94
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:33,789
With a brown bear attack, your only option

95
00:03:33,789 --> 00:03:35,620
is to drop to the ground<br>with your knees to

96
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,939
your chin and your hands<br>protecting your neck.

97
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:40,620
When it sees you're not a<br>threat, it will walk away.

98
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,569
Hopefully.

99
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:42,759
Number seven.

100
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:44,110
Deadly Venom.

101
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:46,569
Sadly, your animal<br>troubles are far from over,

102
00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:48,639
and on another one of<br>your eventful strolls,

103
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:50,689
you get bitten by a venomous snake.

104
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:52,060
The bite is on your lower leg,

105
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,620
and there's nobody around to help.

106
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,409
What are you going to do to<br>get yourself out of this mess?

107
00:03:56,409 --> 00:03:57,750
You could try to suck the venom

108
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,349
out if you're flexible enough.

109
00:03:59,349 --> 00:04:01,270
Or, maybe it would be better to sit still

110
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,319
and apply a tourniquet to the bitten leg.

111
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:05,909
Perhaps washing the bite<br>with clean water and applying

112
00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:08,080
a bandage will help you<br>avoid certain death.

113
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,913
Think fast.

114
00:04:08,913 --> 00:04:09,860
The venom will kill you if

115
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,460
you don't find a way to stop it.

116
00:04:12,311 --> 00:04:14,728
(drum beats)

117
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:24,069
The first option might<br>be tempting if you've

118
00:04:24,069 --> 00:04:26,600
been practicing yoga and are super bendy.

119
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,040
But do you really want venom in your

120
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,459
mouth when it could seep into your

121
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:31,689
bloodstream from tiny cuts in your gums?

122
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:32,730
I don't think so.

123
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,579
Washing your wound is no good either.

124
00:04:34,579 --> 00:04:36,673
It won't stop the venom<br>that's already inside you.

125
00:04:36,673 --> 00:04:38,660
Your only option is to sit still

126
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,629
and keep calm to stop your blood pumping

127
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:42,610
and to apply a tourniquet<br>to block the venom

128
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,740
from getting into the rest of your body.

129
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,850
Number six.

130
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,839
Professor Evil's Puzzle.

131
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:49,670
Animals aren't the only<br>threat to your life,

132
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:53,129
as you find out when you're<br>captured by Professor Evil.

133
00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:55,129
Luckily, the professor's feeling generous,

134
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:57,470
and gives you one opportunity to get free.

135
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:58,519
Don't mess it up.

136
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:00,649
He gives you three doors to choose from.

137
00:05:00,649 --> 00:05:03,360
Two lead to freedom, but<br>the other leads to death.

138
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,089
And you can only ask one yes-or-no

139
00:05:05,089 --> 00:05:07,040
question before making your choice.

140
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,149
Professor Evil will answer the question

141
00:05:09,149 --> 00:05:11,639
honestly if you point to a freedom door,

142
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:14,089
but might lie if you<br>point to the death door.

143
00:05:14,089 --> 00:05:16,019
What's your question going to be?

144
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:17,370
You'd better decide quickly.

145
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:20,052
Professor Evil isn't<br>known for his patience.

146
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:23,334
(drum beats)

147
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:32,519
Your only hope is to point to door A,

148
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:35,199
and ask if door B leads to freedom.

149
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,560
If he says yes, pick door B.

150
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,120
And if the answer is no, choose door C.

151
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,060
Don't get it?

152
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,773
This drawing shows you<br>how my solution works.

153
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,949
Number five.

154
00:05:55,949 --> 00:05:58,069
Mother Nature's Revenge.

155
00:05:58,069 --> 00:06:00,970
Yes, you've got yourself<br>into more trouble.

156
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,490
But this time, it's mother<br>nature that's after you.

157
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:05,209
You're taking a leisurely drive,

158
00:06:05,209 --> 00:06:07,350
presumably to avoid strolling after

159
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:09,089
all your trouble with deadly animals.

160
00:06:09,089 --> 00:06:10,870
And you've stopped to...

161
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,800
Relieve yourself in a field<br>by the side of the road.

162
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,350
Just then, the weather<br>turns dark and stormy

163
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:19,569
and a tornado touches<br>down scarily close to you.

164
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:20,720
There's no shelter.

165
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,899
How are you going to<br>get out of this tangle?

166
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:24,730
Maybe you could climb a tree and take

167
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:26,810
shelter under the leafy branches.

168
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:29,709
Should you find a ditch in<br>the field and curl up in it?

169
00:06:29,709 --> 00:06:31,670
Or should you make a dash<br>for your car and hope

170
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,889
that you get to it<br>before the tornado does?

171
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:34,723
Hurry up.

172
00:06:34,723 --> 00:06:36,952
You've got 10 seconds<br>until it sweeps you up.

173
00:06:38,086 --> 00:06:40,504
(drum beats)

174
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:49,569
Climbing a tree wouldn't do you much good.

175
00:06:49,569 --> 00:06:52,189
How are you planning to hang<br>on if the tornado hits it?

176
00:06:52,189 --> 00:06:54,019
Running for your car is too risky.

177
00:06:54,019 --> 00:06:56,240
And even if you make it,<br>the tornado could still

178
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,600
catch you and pick you<br>up, vehicle and all.

179
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,660
Your best option is to get into the ditch

180
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,730
and make yourself as small as possible.

181
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,430
If the tornado passes over you,

182
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:07,160
it might not be able to lift<br>you from your hiding place.

183
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,841
Honestly though, it serves you right for

184
00:07:08,841 --> 00:07:11,509
leaving yourself outside<br>in the first place.

185
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:12,600
Number four.

186
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,959
Tunnels of Terror.

187
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:15,839
It's a quiet weekend, so you've decided

188
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:17,920
to go exploring in a local cave.

189
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,550
Someone with as much bad luck as

190
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,410
you really shouldn't be doing that.

191
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:22,819
But off you go anyway.

192
00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:24,120
Surprise, surprise.

193
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,970
The worst thing imaginable happens.

194
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:28,399
There's a landslide and<br>your exit is blocked.

195
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:30,709
You manage to find four<br>alternative tunnels,

196
00:07:30,709 --> 00:07:32,720
but conveniently, they all have signs

197
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,959
telling you which<br>dangers lurk inside them.

198
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:36,569
You're going to have<br>to choose from tunnels

199
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:39,149
containing molten lava<br>that will burn you alive,

200
00:07:39,149 --> 00:07:41,560
another huge landslide that will bury you,

201
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,959
poisonous gas that kills all animals,

202
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:46,100
or thousands of deadly spiders.

203
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,579
Which route will you choose?

204
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:48,730
Make your decision.

205
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:51,002
The cave could collapse any second now.

206
00:07:52,002 --> 00:07:54,420
(drum beats)

207
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,120
Three of the tunnels contain things

208
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,959
that will certainly kill humans.

209
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:07,730
But one of them is only<br>dangerous to animals.

210
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:09,579
So long as you're actually a person,

211
00:08:09,579 --> 00:08:11,509
if you select the gas-filled tunnel,

212
00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:13,170
you'll escape unharmed.

213
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:14,410
Number three.

214
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,100
Red and Blue Pills.

215
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,100
Imagine this.

216
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:20,439
You're blind, sick, and you<br>have nobody around to help you.

217
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:21,480
Poor you.

218
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,029
To stay alive, you have to take

219
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:25,250
two tablets every single day.

220
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,930
A blue one and a red one.

221
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,660
The pills feel, smell,<br>and taste identical.

222
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:32,000
So, there's no way of<br>knowing which is which.

223
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,580
The doctor always puts the pills

224
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,049
in a daily pill box for you.

225
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:37,370
But one day, you slip and drop the box,

226
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:39,179
mixing up the two of the days.

227
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:40,610
Oh, no.

228
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:42,450
You need to take the pills today and the

229
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,779
doctor can't get to you until tomorrow.

230
00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:46,320
How are you going to figure out which of

231
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,269
the four dropped pills you should take?

232
00:08:49,205 --> 00:08:51,621
(drum beats)

233
00:08:58,899 --> 00:09:00,409
The only way to do it is to break

234
00:09:00,409 --> 00:09:02,129
all four pills into halves.

235
00:09:02,129 --> 00:09:05,539
Then put half of each one<br>into two separate piles.

236
00:09:05,539 --> 00:09:08,330
In the end, you'll have two<br>piles containing four halves,

237
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,820
which guarantees that<br>you'll take the right dose.

238
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,990
Number two.

239
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,629
Deadly Inferno.

240
00:09:13,629 --> 00:09:14,950
Oh, no.

241
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:16,610
You're trapped in another room.

242
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,500
And this time, it's on fire.

243
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,059
How do you get yourself<br>into these situations?

244
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:23,179
The fire is blazing<br>between you and the door,

245
00:09:23,179 --> 00:09:25,759
and there's no other way<br>of escaping the inferno.

246
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,120
Firefighters are on their way,

247
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,259
but you'll need to figure out how

248
00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:30,330
to stay safe until they arrive.

249
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,710
You consider your options.

250
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:34,110
You could get on the ground<br>and stay as low as possible,

251
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,320
or you could stand on the chair

252
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,730
to get close to the ceiling.

253
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,960
You could take your<br>clothes off to stay cool,

254
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,429
and possibly give the<br>firefighters a fright.

255
00:09:41,429 --> 00:09:43,159
Or you could hide under a desk.

256
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:44,570
Which will you do?

257
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:45,403
Quick, quick.

258
00:09:45,403 --> 00:09:48,144
The smoke is getting<br>thicker by the minute.

259
00:09:48,144 --> 00:09:50,562
(drum beats)

260
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,740
Firstly, getting on top of<br>a chair is a terrible idea.

261
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,500
Smoke and heat both rise,

262
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,419
so you wouldn't stand a chance up there.

263
00:10:04,419 --> 00:10:06,990
Taking your clothes off will<br>expose your skin to the heat,

264
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:09,370
which is not what you want<br>for your delicate parts.

265
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,899
And getting under a desk<br>won't really help you much.

266
00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:14,549
Your only choice is to get as<br>low to the floor as possible,

267
00:10:14,549 --> 00:10:16,190
so you don't suffocate from the smoke,

268
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:18,240
and just wait until help comes.

269
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,509
Number one.

270
00:10:19,509 --> 00:10:21,440
Four Rooms of Fear.

271
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,539
Congratulations.

272
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:24,570
You've made it to my final conundrum.

273
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:25,830
You're condemned to death for

274
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,529
crimes too terrible to speak of,

275
00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:29,659
and your cruel and unusual executioner

276
00:10:29,659 --> 00:10:31,639
gives you the choice between four tanks,

277
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:33,149
which you'll enter from the top.

278
00:10:33,149 --> 00:10:34,559
And which you'll meet your fate.

279
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:36,269
The first room contains a vat full

280
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:38,120
of acid as deep as your chest.

281
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,429
The second is full of blood-thirsty<br>murderers ready to kill.

282
00:10:41,429 --> 00:10:43,830
The third is blazing with raging fires,

283
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:46,379
and the fourth contains a<br>pool full of blood-thirsty

284
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,889
sharks that haven't eaten in six months.

285
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:51,173
Which horrifying fate do you choose?

286
00:10:52,062 --> 00:10:54,480
(drum beats)

287
00:11:01,789 --> 00:11:04,350
Every room sounds<br>terrifying beyond belief.

288
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:07,649
But if I was you, I'd go for<br>the shark-infested waters.

289
00:11:07,649 --> 00:11:10,460
After all, if the sharks<br>haven't eaten for six months,

290
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,909
they'd all be dead and<br>no danger to you at all.

291
00:11:12,909 --> 00:11:14,029
Congratulations.

292
00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:16,049
You've survived my 10 deadly riddles.

293
00:11:16,049 --> 00:11:17,429
Did you solve them all?

294
00:11:17,429 --> 00:11:19,340
Let me know in the comment<br>section down below.

295
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,057
And thanks for watching.

296
00:11:21,057 --> 00:11:23,639
(gentle music)

297
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,139
